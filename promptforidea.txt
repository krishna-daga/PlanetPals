I am making a game, the concept is that the game generates a task (based on different categories) but the 
tasks are arounf making the earth a better place, like picking up trash from local park, using bucket of water 
to take bath instead of shower, putting out water for birds, but very simple doable tasks wchih motivates people 
to be more sustainable, eco-friendly. I have an idea where the user can upload images of their task, get points, 
I don't know what they can do with these points so help me with a free solution (i do not have funding as of now 
so cannot give monetory rewards), have a community where people can share achievemnets , ideas, make friends, 
people can also add friends and share their acjievemnmet of social media, I want to give badges for a threshold 
of points reached. 
Give me more ideas to make this app more fun and motivates people to participate on this task. Be creative
